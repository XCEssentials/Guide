# Introduction

Are you software developer coming from another platform to iOS? Are you beginner developer trying to catch up with all the latest technologies and libraries in iOS world and begin developing production ready apps as soon as possible? Do you want to bring your whole team on the same page without spending months on inventing and explaining your own "corporate" rules on iOS development? This guide is for you!

This guide is about how to write iOS app from scratch, making your code done right from the beginning, keep it clean, scaleable, reliable.
